# Feature Logger (Claude Code hook)

Records what each Claude Code **work session** did — files changed, token usage, and a
plain-language "what we did" summary — to `~/.claude/feature-log/`. The companion app
(this repo) reads those files and shows them as a **Feature Dashboard**.

No `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` required: the end-of-session summary is written by `claude -p`,
which uses your existing Claude Code subscription.

## How it works

It registers two global hooks:

- **`Stop`** (fires every turn) — cheap, no LLM. Parses the session transcript and upserts
  `~/.claude/feature-log/<project-slug>/<session_id>.json` with token totals, files changed
  (bucketed by feature area), key commands, your prompts, and timestamps. Idempotent: it
  recomputes from the transcript each turn, so re-runs update the same file.
- **`SessionEnd`** (fires once when the session ends) — builds a compact prompt from the
  captured data (never the whole transcript) and calls `claude -p --output-format json` to
  write a headline + 2–4 sentence narrative, storing it (and the summary's own token cost).
  Falls back to a heuristic summary if `claude` isn't available.

Recursion is prevented two ways: the hook exits early when `stop_hook_active` is true, and
it sets `FEATURE_LOGGER_ACTIVE=1` before calling `claude -p` (the child inherits it and
its hooks short-circuit). Every path exits 0, so it never blocks your turn.

## Install

```bash
node tools/feature-logger/install.mjs
```

This copies the script to `~/.claude/feature-logger/` and merges the two hooks into
`~/.claude/settings.json` (backing it up first; it never touches the managed
`launcher-settings.json`). Start a **new** Claude Code session for the hooks to load.

## Manual install

If the installer can't write `~/.claude/settings.json` (e.g. a managed/cloud container),
copy `feature-logger.mjs` to `~/.claude/feature-logger/` yourself and add this to
`~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "Stop": [
      { "matcher": "", "hooks": [ { "type": "command", "command": "~/.claude/feature-logger/feature-logger.mjs", "timeout": 60 } ] }
    ],
    "SessionEnd": [
      { "matcher": "", "hooks": [ { "type": "command", "command": "~/.claude/feature-logger/feature-logger.mjs", "timeout": 60 } ] }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Test without installing

You can exercise the hook by piping a synthetic event at a real transcript:

```bash
echo '{"hook_event_name":"Stop","session_id":"test","stop_hook_active":false,
  "cwd":"'"$PWD"'","transcript_path":"<path-to-a-session>.jsonl"}' \
  | node tools/feature-logger/feature-logger.mjs

cat ~/.claude/feature-log/*/test.json
```

Use `"hook_event_name":"SessionEnd"` to also generate the Claude-written summary.

## Privacy

Records contain file paths, commands, your prompts, and a summary — keep them local; the
dashboard is a local dev tool, not something to deploy publicly.
